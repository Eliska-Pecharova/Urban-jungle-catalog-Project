Welcome to the Urban Jungle Catalog! This is an interactive web-based gallery for houseplant enthusiasts, designed to help users organize and explore their indoor greenery. The project focuses on clean UI, smooth interactions, and responsive design.

🚀 About the Project

This project was built to showcase my frontend development skills. The main goal was to create a functional plant library where users can easily find essential care information, difficulty levels, and origin details for various plants.

Key Features:

Plant Gallery: A clean grid layout featuring cards for different plant species.
Dynamic Filtering: Ability to filter plants based on care requirements (e.g., "Beginner Friendly").
Care Details: Each plant includes intuitive icons for light conditions and watering schedules.
Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🛠 Tech Stack

I utilized the following technologies to build this application:
HTML5: Semantic structure for better accessibility and SEO.
CSS3 / Tailwind CSS: Modern styling using Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout management.
JavaScript (ES6+): Logic for dynamic data rendering and interactive UI components.
Git & GitHub: Version control and project hosting.
